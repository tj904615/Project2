# Project Name: DevState
https://hidden-tor-80786.herokuapp.com/
-----------
## Description
<b>What is DevState?</b>
Eliminate hassle from daily task management. Designed for project leads and contributors, DevState presents a clear, easy to understand interface and method to keep teams coordinated.

----------

## Motivation
<b>Why did we build this app?</b>
Task management has become too complex. 
Inspired by project management tools like github, basecamp, and monday.com, our team wanted to implement the MVP for a task management application.

------------

## Results
<b>How did it turn out?</b>
The current DevState app achieves functionality and simplicity.
The current DevState implementation features:
<ul><li>Authenticated Login</li>
    <li>Get, Put, Read MySQL functionality</li>
    <li>Dynamic UI</li>
    <li>Node implementation</li></ul>

-----------

## Team Efforts
<b>Delegate & Conquer</b>
<i>DevState was a fully collaborative endeavor.</i>
Together, the team contributed concepts and chose this project for our application. Each team member gave input on names, implementation, data structure, and interface. Marcus Kelly contributed express routing, server logic, and database interaction. Stephen Fox contributed HTML/CSS, JQuery, and presentation. TJ Bryant and Chase Cannon established schema structure, repo management, and presentation notes.

### Challenges
<b>Overcoming the Unexpected</b>
Managing tasks, commits, and workload always presents a challenge. From a technical standpoint, user authentication and database queries presented the biggest hurdles. On an inter-personal level — it’s always difficult to coordinate the schedule of four individuals.
